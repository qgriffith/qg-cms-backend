# qg-cms-frontend
A fun project I am working on to learn more about  [Strapi](https://strapi.io/) to create a headless personal CMS site. That will have a [frontednd](https://github.com/qgriffith/qg-cms-frontend) created in [NextJs](https://nextjs.org/) This will power [qgriffith.com](https://www.qgriffith.com)

## Commands

* `npm install` - Install all the needed node packages
* `npm run develop` - Start the development server
* `npm run build` - Build the site for production
* `npm run start` - Start the production server
